# Value Instrument Alpha

This repository includes an implementation of the Value Instrument's four principles in monetary design, that aim to stimulate economic activity in communities. This alpha version is coded with blockchain technology in mind, yet it does not run on or connect to any blockchain in its current state.

Installing and running this alpha will give you an online-banking-web-app with a chat-like user interface.

### Principles presented in this alpha

* You get Value on a regular basis.
* You burn the amounts received, if not used within their lifetime.
* Your received amounts always have fully renewed lifetime.
* You pay a transaction fee, to avoid ping-pong transfers for regaining new lifetime.
